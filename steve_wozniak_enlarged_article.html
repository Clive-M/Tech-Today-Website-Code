              Reports are emerging that Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, also
              known as Woz, has been hospitalized in Mexico City. The
              73-year-old tech pioneer was attending the World Business Forum
              (WBF) when the incident occurred, details of which remain unclear.
              According to an unnamed source from the WBF, Wozniak fainted on
              Wednesday afternoon during the business conference. The cause of
              his sudden illness is currently unknown, and there has been no
              official statement from Wozniak's representatives. The BBC reached
              out for comment, but as of now, there has been no response.
              Wozniak, a key figure in Silicon Valley, played a pivotal role in
              the founding of Apple alongside Steve Jobs in 1976. Together, they
              introduced the world to the first Apple computer, and the company
              went on to become the most valuable in the world. This incident
              comes at a time when Wozniak has been actively advocating for
              ethical considerations in technology. In March, he joined forces
              with Elon Musk to call for a pause in the development of highly
              advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models. Wozniak expressed
              concerns about the potential misuse of AI technology by malicious
              entities, emphasizing the need for regulatory measures. Speaking
              to the BBC in May 2023, Wozniak highlighted the intelligence of
              AI, making it susceptible to exploitation by "bad actors" who aim
              to deceive individuals. He urged for regulatory frameworks to be
              put in place to address the risks associated with AI development.
              However, he also expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of
              regulatory efforts, stating, "I think the forces that drive for
              money usually win out, which is sort of sad." As the tech
              community and Apple enthusiasts await updates on Wozniak's health,
              the incident serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges and
              ethical considerations surrounding advancements in technology.
